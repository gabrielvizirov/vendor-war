Gnostech Inc. Programming Challenge v1.0
========================================

Gnostech Inc. is looking to buy the next generation of laptops. However, they're having 
difficulty choosing between a few of the vendors. While brainstorming and conducting 
several engineering evaluations, they cannot decide which vendor to choose...
so they have asked each vendor to bring their best 'fighter' for a "Vendor War"!


-------------------------
Details:
-------------------------

The fighters weapon of choice is a mouse...yes, they will be swinging a mouse!
Each fighter must engage in a 'mano a mano' match with the other fighters. 

A match consists of one or more rounds where two fighters square off in a fight until one 
fighter gets hit by a mouse so hard by another fighter that he or she literally can't walk. This is 
serious business.

In each round, the fighters alternate hitting each other with the mouse until both fighters have exhausted
the number of attacks they are permitted, or a fighter's health reaches or drops below 0. You 
may randomly choose who attacks first in each round, or if you're feeling spicy, you can implement
an initiative system using the initiative data supplied in the import file.

-------------------------
Requirements:
-------------------------

The application must import the provided fighter spreadsheet (vendor_fighters.csv), which contains
the vitals for each fighter. Each fighter must then fight against all the other fighters. 
The fighter with the highest winning percentage after all the matches are completed gets the 
laptop procurement contract with Gnostech!

-------------------------
Example match:
-------------------------

	Fighter 1:
		Health: 46
		Damage: 3
		Attacks: 5

	Fighter 2:
		Health: 52
		Damage: 8
		Attacks: 2

	Round 1:
		Fighter 1 is randomly selected to go first (43 > 40)  <-- initiative roll
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (52 -> 49)    <-- Damage applied (health before damage -> health after damage)
		Fighter 2 hits fighter 1 for 8 damage (46 -> 38)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (49 -> 46)
		Fighter 2 hits fighter 1 for 8 damage (38 -> 30)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (46 -> 43)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (43 -> 40)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (40 -> 37)
		
	Round 2:
		Fighter 1 is randomly selected to go first (26 > 11)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (37 -> 34)
		Fighter 2 hits fighter 1 for 8 damage (30 -> 22)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (34 -> 31)
		Fighter 2 hits fighter 1 for 8 damage (22 -> 14)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (31 -> 28)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (28 -> 25)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (25 -> 22)
		
	Round 3:
		Fighter 2 is randomly selected to go first (35 > 29)
		Fighter 2 hits fighter 1 for 8 damage (14 -> 6)
		Fighter 1 hits fighter 2 for 3 damage (22 -> 19)
		Fighter 2 hits fighter 1 for 8 damage (6 -> -2)
		Fighter 2 wins!

Additional info:
-------------------------

Try to keep the application output clear and readable, but concise. Using the above output
format would work fine, though feel free to provide what you feel is best.

In regards to program design, you have complete control. This challenge was designed to
get a feel for your problem solving ability and creativity.

-------------------------
Vitals:
-------------------------
	Vendor 		- Vendor (represented by fighter)
	Health 		- Starting health
	Damage 		- Damage that each 'mouse swing' inflicts
	Attacks 	- Number of attacks per round
	
I've also included some additional columns in the spreadsheet that you can incorporate if
you have extra time:

	Dodge 		- Percentage chance to dodge
	Critical 	- Percentage chance to inflict critical damage (x2)
	Initiative 	- Added to random roll for deciding who goes first each round

The time limit for this challenge is no more than 180 minutes. Java is the preferred language. Place your application files into a zip file titled with your name and email it back.
